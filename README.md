# Guess The Flag

---

## Introduction

This is a React project created by me, showcasing the flags of 227 countries and territories worldwide. Styled-components are utilized for managing the visual appearance, ensuring a polished and dynamic user experience. Players engage with the game by guessing the country based on its flag. It's an interactive way to test your knowledge of world flags. This project is playable on both desktop and on a mobile device!
