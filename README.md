# Guess The Flag

---

## Introduction

This is a React project made by me showcasing flags of 227 countries and territories worldwide. Styled-components are utilized for managing the visual appearance, ensuring a polished and dynamic user experience. Players engage with the game by guessing the country based on its flag. It's an interactive way to test your knowledge of world flags.
